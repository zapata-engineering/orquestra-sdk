"""
Centralized place to store the information about where the code runs.
This module is likely to be used from many places. It shouldn't import any
3rd-party libraries (like ray).

The problem this module solves: our code needs to know if it's running in a standalone
script vs a local Ray task vs task on QE vs [insert more in the future]. How to pass
this information?

The solution: global variable set by the runtimes just before executing task code. To
make this as robust as possible, the flag needs to be set inside the same process that
executes the task, otherwise we risk bugs related to passing global state across
workers.
