# Orquestra Workflow Shared

This library isn't meant to be used directly by external users. Please use [orquestra-sdk](https://github.com/zapata-engineering/orquestra-sdk/tree/main/projects/orquestra-sdk) instead.

Interfaces and other code we have to share between the user-facing clients and the workflow execution servers. We should strive to keep it as small as possible.
