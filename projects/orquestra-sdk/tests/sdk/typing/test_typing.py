"""
The purpose of these tests are to ensure type hints are correctly mapped from the user's
function to the final SDK object.

This also includes correctly showing attributes/methods/properties that the SDK provides
on top of the user's function. For example, `WorkflowDef.local_run()`.

We're going to use `mypy` for these tests as we already assume it's installed. However,
we can't rely on the style checks for these tests: we also test for errors that could
happen.
