"""
Unit tests for config IO. Before editing this file, please consider writing the
CLI usage scenario in tests/cli/test_cli_with_qe.py first. Motivation below.

Due to complexity of handling configs we've seen that usually it's difficult to
figure out the expected behavior for unit tests. We've had multiple situations
where:
- We work on a bug fix related to configs
- The bug scenario was fixed. Some other unit tests fail. We change the other
  tests to pass.
- We're introducing another bug in the process.

The current solution for this is to focus on testing the layer that's close to
the user. It's a lot easier to figure out appropriate behavior this way.
