# Changelog

## Unreleased

üö® *Breaking Changes*
* Removed FluentBit-related CLI options: `orq {up,down} --fluentbit` flag. Logs produced by the local Ray runtime are read directly by the SDK now. This only affects users who used the experimental integration with FluentBit docker container.
* `GitImport` will no longer be downloaded automatically when using Ray locally. This reverts behavior to `v0.42.0`.
* Internal configuration environment variables have changed.


üî• *Features*
* Secrets can now be used inside workflow functions
* `sdk.secrets.get("name")` will now use passport-based authorization if `ORQUESTRA_PASSPORT_FILE` environment variable is set. Otherwise, passing a valid `config_name="..."` is required.
* Bump Ray version to 2.3
* `GithubImport` can be used with a username and a secret referring to a "personal access token" to enable private GitHub repositories on Compute Engine. Server side support coming soon!


üë©‚Äçüî¨ *Experimental*


üêõ *Bug Fixes*
* Getting full logs produced by Ray workflows. Previously, the dictionary returned by `logs_dict = wf_run.get_logs()` had just a single entry: `{"logs": ["task 1 log", "task 1 log", "task 2 log", "task 2 log"]}`. Now, the dictionary has a correct shape: `{"task_invocation_id1": ["task 1 log", "task 1 log"], "task_invocation_id2": ["task 2 log", "task 2 log"]}`.
* Getting single task logs. Previously `orq task logs` would raise an unhandled exception. Now, it prints the log lines.
* Workflow run IDs inside logs on CE now match the expected run ID.


üíÖ *Improvements*
* `orq wf view` now shows `TaskInvocationID`s instead of `TaskRunID`s. This improves usage of `orq wf view` with other CLI commands that require passing invocation ID, like `orq task {logs,results}`.
* `sdk.WorkflowRun.wait_until_finished()` will now print workflow status every now and then.


*Internal*
* Git URL model changed inside the IR
* `orq up` will now configure Ray's Plasma directory


*Docs*


## v0.43.0

üö® *Breaking Changes*
* Brand-new `orq` CLI with simplified command tree and interactive prompts when a required argument isn't passed. New commands:
    * `orq workflow submit`
    * `orq workflow view`
    * `orq workflow list`
    * `orq workflow stop`
    * `orq workflow logs`
    * `orq workflow results`
    * `orq wf` as a shorthand for `orq workflow`
    * `orq task logs`
    * `orq task results`
    * `orq up`
    * `orq down`
    * `orq status`
    * `orq login`
* `sdk.WorkflowRun.get_logs()` doesn't accept any arguments any more. Now, it returns all the logs produced by the tasks in the workflow. If you're interested in only a subset of your workflow's logs, please consider using one of the following filtering options:
```python
from orquestra import sdk
from orquestra.sdk.schema.workflow_run import State

wf_run = sdk.WorkflowRun.by_id("foo")

logs = wf_run.get_logs()
# Option 1
single_task_logs = logs["my_inv_id"]

# Option 2
logs_subset = {id: lines for id, lines in logs.items() if id in ["foo", "bar", "baz"]}

# Option 3
for task in wf_run.get_tasks():
    if task.get_status() == State.FAILED:
        print(task.get_logs())
```
* `sdk.WorkflowRun.get_artifacts()` doesn't accept any arguments any more. Now, it returns all the artifacts produced by the tasks in the workflow.
* `sdk.TaskRun.get_logs()` returns a list of log lines produced by this task. Previously, it returned a dictionary with one entry.
* Executing a workflow on Ray with Git imports will now install them. A known limitation is that this will only work for Git repositories that are Python packages and will fail for Git repositories that are not Python packages.
* The API will no longer accept `config_save_file` as optional parameters, from now on if you want to use a different config file use the `ORQ_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.


üî• *Features*

* `list_workflow_runs` added to the Public API. This lets you list the workflows for a given config, for example `sdk.list_workflow_runs("ray")` or `sdk.list_workflow_runs("prod-d")`.

üêõ *Bug Fixes*

* Fixed broken link on docs landing page.
* Internal logs from Ray are no longer displayed.
* Fixed the docstrings for `sdk.WorkflowRun.get_artifacts()`. It returns a dictionary with `TaskInvocationID` as keys and whatever the task returns as values.
* Fixed bug where some log line from Ray may be duplicated when viewing logs
* Tasks with duplicate imports will no longer fail when running on QE
* AST parser will no longer print a lot of "Info" messages
* `sdk.WorkflowRun.get_logs()` now only returns logs produced by the user. Previously, it included internal debug messages produced by Ray.
* Logs from workflows submitted to Ray are now always returned as JSONL lines


## v0.42.0

üö® *Breaking Changes*

* `sdk.WorkflowRun.by_id()` has a new positional parameter. `sdk.WorkflowRun.by_id("wf.1", "my/project/path", "my/config/path)` becomes `sdk.WorkflowRun.by_id("wf.1", project_dir="my/project/path", config_save_file="my/config/path)`
* `in_process` runtime now executes workflows in topological order. This may be different to the order tasks were called in the workflow function.
* Configs can no longer be named. For in-process, use "in_process" name, for local ray "ray" or "local". For QE remote - config name is auto generated based on URI (for https://prod-d.orquestra.io/ name becomes "prod-d" as an example).
* Removed ray_linked runtime.


üë©‚Äçüî¨ *Experimental*

* Optional `config` param in `sdk.WorkflowRun.by_id()`. Allows access to workflows submitted by other users or from another machine, if the selected runtime supports it. Per-runtime support will be added separately.
* New CLI command: `python -m orquestra.sdk._base.cli._dorq._entry workflow stop`.
* New CLI commands that require `config` and `workflow_run_id` will now prompt the user for selecting value interactively.
* New CLI commands: `python -m orquestra.sdk._base.cli._dorq._entry up|down|status` for managing local services.


## v0.41.0

üö® *Breaking Changes*

* `ray` is now a reserved configuration name.

üî• *Features*

* Workflow def graph visualization via `my_wf().graph` (#317). The output object is rendered natively by Jupyter. For now, this shows task invocations and artifacts. Tasks run status will be added in the future, stay tuned!
* Automatically get the workflow run and task run ID on Argo when using `wfprint()`.
* `"ray"` can be used as an alias for `"local"` when using `RuntimeConfig.load(...)` or `WorkflowRun.run()`.
* New Python API to traverse and debug tasks in workflow: `wf_run.get_tasks()` (#283)
* New Runtime Config for CE (AKA Ray Remote): `RuntimeConfig.ce()`
* Public API for serializable model of the workflow run state: `sdk.WorkflowRun.get_status_model()`. Potential use cases include workflow status visualization by external tools.

üë©‚Äçüî¨ *Experimental*

* Prototype of a new CLI command tree: `python -m orquestra.sdk._base.cli._dorq._entry workflow {submit,view}`.
* New Runtime for the Compute Engine API

üêõ *Bug Fixes*

* Fix `sdk.task()` typing when constructing a task inside a workflow.
* Fix getting logs from Ray after restarting the cluster, when not using Fluent.
* `WorkflowRun.get_results()` should return a Sequence instead of an Iterable.

*Internal*

* Allow Studio/Portal to override SDK internals.
* Workflow run endpoints added to the workflow driver client
* Deserialise workflow artifacts from Workflow Driver
* Add CODEOWNERS file
* Simplify internal interfaces
* Refactor: move old CLI code into a submodule.
* Remove obsolete system deps installation to speed up tests.
* Ignore slow tests in local development.

*Docs*

* Streamline installation & quickstart tutorials (#324)
* Create tutorial for parametrized workflows.
* Cleanup and unify tutorials for local Ray execution
* Cleanup and unify tutorials for remote QE execution (#341)
* Add recipe for running VQE on quantum hardware.

üö® *Breaking Changes*

* `WorkflowDef.run()` now requires passing config name explicitly (#308)

üî• *Features*

* public API for secrets (#304). Supports usage from workflows on Ray, QE, and local scripts.
* `orq create-config` command for explicit creation of configs

üêõ *Bug Fixes*

* Fix Unknown error '_DockerClient' object has no attribute '_client' error when `python_on_whales` is installed (#314)
