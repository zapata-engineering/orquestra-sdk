Speed up Reading Logs with Fluentbit
====================================


This tutorial describes how to use Fluentbit to improve performance of collecting Ray logs.
This procedure is optional.
Reading Ray's logs will work even without it, but the built-in behavior might result in poor performance of reading historical logs.


Prerequisites
=============

#. You've :doc:`installed Orquestra Workflow SDK<installing-macos-linux>`.
#. You've :doc:`defined a task and a workflow<quickstart>` in a ``workflow_defs.py`` file.


Set Up Docker
=============

Linux Users
-------------
Install ``docker``, ``docker-compose`` and ``docker-compose-plugin`` from your OS packaging, e.g.::

   sudo apt install docker
   sudo apt install docker-compose
   sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin


Now, you are ready to start ``docker``::

    sudo systemctl start docker

macOS Users
------------

Install ``colima``, ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``::

    brew install colima
    brew install docker
    brew install docker-compose

Create the suggested symlink::

   mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
   ln -sfn $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-compose/bin/docker-compose ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

If Docker does not use the macOS keychain for secret storage, please update your configuration::

    cat ~/.docker/config.json
    {
	      "auths": {},
	      "credsStore": "osxkeychain",
	      "currentContext": "colima"
    }

Now, you are ready to start Colima::

    colima start


Start Services
==============

Ray-based local runtime requires some services to run in the background: Ray cluster and Fluentbit docker container.
There's a handy command to start them::

    orq up --all

This only needs to be once until you reboot your computer or
you stop services manually using the command::

   orq down --all


Run Workflows
=============

When Ray and Fluentbit daemons are running in the background you can proceed with standard usage of Orquestra Workflow SDK with Ray.
To continue, please follow :doc:`Running locally with Ray <ray>` starting from section "Execute workflow" (skip starting Ray because ``orq up`` did it).
